<p align="center"> Simple Notes web app build with Vue.js made for PC </p>

<hr/>

<p> There are many notes apps, but I needed something simple that works for me on my laptop. That is why I made my notes that will work in my browser locally. Everything is stored in your web browser localStorage. All the coding is done with Vue.js and the best part is everything is in the index.html file that is only 4Kb. </p>

<p>I also building My Notes.app for Mac OS users. I am learning to use <a href="https://electronjs.org">Electron</a> to package the app. I am thinking about the app size might go up to 100 Mb or more i guess. But I am in a plan to use <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/osx/">Cordova for Mac</a> and it's quiet intresting.</p>
